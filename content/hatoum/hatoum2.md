The body is central to Mona Hatoum’s work. While in early performances and works she used her own body—for example, her billboard *Over my dead body* (1988/2002) features the artist’s profile, a tiny toy soldier positioned on her nose to point his gun at her temple—her installation works implicate the viewer in a physical experience. The gigantic scale of her sculptures induce a kind of *Alice in Wonderland* effect,[^1] overwhelming the viewer’s space, while sleek materials like marble and glass seduce. “You first experience an artwork physically,” says the artist.[^2] Meanings and associations emerge as the form of an oversized metal grater comes to resemble a bed, for example, or the fragility of glass playground swings pose potential destruction. Hatoum’s intention “to create a situation where reality itself becomes a questionable point”[^3] manifests in physical sensations.
