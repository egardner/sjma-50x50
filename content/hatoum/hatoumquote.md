**Mona Hatoum**

Lebanon/England, b. 1952

Since my early performances, the body has been central to my work. Even before that I was making small works on paper using bodily fluids and body rejects as materials. I have always been dissatisfied with work that just appeals to your intellect . . . the body is the axis of our perceptions, so how can art afford not to take that as a starting point?[^1]
