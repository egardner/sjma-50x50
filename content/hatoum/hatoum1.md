**Political Performance**

Mona Hatoum was born in Beirut, where her Palestinian parents settled after being exiled during the Arab-Israeli War in 1948. In 1975, while on a short trip to London, the Lebanese Civil War broke out and prevented her return home. She remained in London, and between 1979 and 1985 she studied art at Byam Shaw School of Art and Slade School of Fine Art.[^1] “The Slade politicized me,” said the artist. “I got involved in feminist groups . . . started examining power structures and trying to understand why I felt so ‘out of place.’”[^2] Ideas around instability and displacement appeared early in Hatoum’s experimental, even dangerous work, like running 240 volts of electricity through a circuit of metal household objects, and she began making temporary performance works too hazardous for galleries. In *Variations on Discord and Divisions* (1984), the artist crawled onto a stage covered in sheets of newspaper to scrub the floor with a bucket of red liquid; she cut through her ski mask with a knife, violently arranged a dining table and two chairs like an interrogation situation, and later projected a newsreel reading “35,000 people have been the victims of death squads since 1980. 1,500 people have been butchered in cold blood in Nazi-like fashion. . . . Twin refugee camps. . . Oppressed people. Famine worse than ever.”[^3] Like the sculptural work that followed, the scene was deeply sinister and placed the body in a vulnerable relationship with the home and the state—with cultural, historical, and economic forces.
