Lee Mullican at his studio in Venice, California, ca. 1950. Filmed by Betsy Drake.

When Lee Mullican found himself one day without a paintbrush, he reached instead for a printer’s knife. At the time he was staying with Jack Stauffacher, a printer Mullican had met while in the Army who ran the Greenwood Press in San Francisco. Borrowing Stauffacher’s “marvelous tool”[^1]—a knife with a flexible blade used to apply ink to rollers—Mullican developed a distinguished approach to mark making by adapting the blade’s square tip to apply and score paint, creating abstract forms from linear dashes that resemble geometric glyphs or stitches in textiles.
