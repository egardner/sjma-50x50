Lee Mullican realized early in his career that his signature painting style created surfaces that resemble woven objects. When he came across a Pomo Native American basket at a San Francisco antique shop, the artist recognized the slightly three-dimensional, parallel marks: “The kind of feathered surface of the basket was a little bit like what I was doing in painting.”[^1] Though his technique remained the same, the conflict he felt between abstraction and image was a constant challenge. In *Nightshade* (1958), a work made after the artist moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles, images seem to emerge from a palette quieter than most of the artist’s other works. “It was at this time that I began to realize that I didn’t need to be quite such a purist—or quite that abstract. . . . I began to employ certain aspects of heads and bodies and invented animal forms.”[^2]
