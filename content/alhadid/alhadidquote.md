>What concerns me the most is how to get you to pay attention to weight and volume and space and interiors and exteriors. . . . I want to make something that seems really improbable. . . . I have enough reality in my life. Not that I live in some weird fantasy world, but I want to weigh in a little bit on the other side.[^1]
