Diana Al-Hadid finds inspiration in the classical forms of Western and Islamic civilization, in structures like Gothic cathedrals, the Citadel of Aleppo, the Tower of Babel, and thirteenth-century Syrian water clocks. But these original images are often obscured in her material translations, their grandiose histories submerged in a state of decay; as the artist explains, “the fantasy of restoring the past is deeply engrained in us, but it’s also irrational and it’s impossible.”[^1] Al-Hadid’s large sculpture *The Candle Clock in the Citadel* (2017) was inspired by the visionary drawings of a candle clock by thirteenth-century inventor Al-Jazari—a mechanical device outlined in his *Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices* (1206) that measures the passage of time using the weight of melting candle wax. Made of dripping polymer gypsum, Al-Hadid’s creation *looks both like a ruin of* Al-Jazari’s *functional timepiece and a fantastical contraption, conveying* a sense of “familiarity with something not directly experienced, or a kind of yearning, an almost tactile nostalgia.”[^2]
