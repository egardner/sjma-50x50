Mary Corse stripped painting bare. In pursuit of moving beyond representation toward a true—or non-subjective—reality, she stopped using color in her work and sanded surfaces to eliminate the traces of her gesture. When all else was removed, Corse was left with two elements: light and space. Using white light tubes with argon gas, she illuminated sheets of Plexiglas to create glowing, wireless planes of light.[^1] The artist took a physics class to learn how to build Tesla coils, which emitted a high frequency energy that passed through air—rather than through a wire—to light the gas tubes from a distance. This made it possible for her Plexiglas paintings to appear autonomous: “the object can be completely free from the external world, from any world but its own.”[^2] In her studies, Corse was introduced to quantum physics, which challenged her ideas of objectivity and eventually altered the way she looked at the world. The artist stopped searching for a pure, objective reality, instead understanding reality as only approachable through individual perception. After that, a formal subjectivity, evidenced by visible brushstrokes, returned to her work.[^3]
