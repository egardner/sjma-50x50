**Travel Tales to Children’s Books**

The imaginary worlds of literature animate Roy De Forest’s storytelling paintings. An avid reader since childhood, he maintained a kind of encyclopedic knowledge of his interests in quantum physics to Egyptology—his mother was a mystic, and they frequently visited the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum in San José, California.[^1] De Forest read travel, adventure, and Western frontier tales—Jack London and Mark Twain were among his favorites—and kept children’s books around his studio. He was a lover of poetry, to which he attributed his creative titles. When the artist died in 2007, his personal library held more than two thousand titles.
