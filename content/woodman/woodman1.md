Though she practiced ceramics throughout her artistic career, Betty Woodman might likewise be characterized as a painter. Vivid splashes of color decorate her clay vessels, known for their large scale and winged appendages. But as the artist explained, “what I’m dealing with is as much painting as it is sculpture.”[^1] Her works are a marriage of surface and form, wherein paint moves to respond to the geometries of the ceramic vessel and its shape extends the painted picture. Expanding on notions of the still life and her woodblock collages, Woodman pulls the vase from the painting’s surface. As art critic Arthur Danto described, “as if the pitcher was not transcribed but transformed, as if expressive drawing of the Cubist still life and the splashy color of the Fauve still life were transferred back to reality, so that the new still life obviates the need to paint it.”[^2]
