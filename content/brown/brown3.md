In the 1960s and 70s, Joan Brown’s paintings became increasingly autobiographical, with self-portraiture the primary process for introspection and self-definition.[^1] Depicting her role as a mother, an artist, a woman, and a lover, she documented intimate moments of her life, as in the beginning of a love affair abroad in *The Journey#1*(1976), which she produced after spending the summer of 1976 traveling in Europe. As she explained: “I strongly feel the need to put this introspection in the form of pictures, I then become the ‘student’ and consciously ‘study’ the content of the pictures I’ve painted. . . . Looking in the mirror, becoming a spectator, literally describing myself, is a very graphic way of being introspective.”[^2]
