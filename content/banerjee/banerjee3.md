Rina Banerjee’s titles rebel against the English language and its global dominance. Though written in English, they are long and poetic with eccentric spellings—as the artist explained, “an attempt to massage it to speak for a vast number of people who use it sparingly, awkwardly, creatively under the pressure of globalization, colonization, and commercialization of English culture.”[^1] Banerjee’s enigmatic and dramatic titles are essential elements of her work, conceived after the object’s completion. Like the materials in her sculptures, words unite and collide beautifully and awkwardly; they evoke harmonies and contradictions and capture a sense of global cultural hybridity.
