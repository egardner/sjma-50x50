**Climate and Feminism**

Rina Banerjee engages ideas related to intersectional feminism—considering women’s overlapping identities due to race, class, and religion—together with the impacts of climate change. The flower is a common motif in her work, variously referring to femininity, fecundity, and nature. *Winter’s Flower (2010)*, which is fashioned with materials both faux and natural and borrowed from fashion and home décor, is a kind of chimera—its grafted elements suggest an alternative vision for human interaction with our planet.
