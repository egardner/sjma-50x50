Rina Banerjee’s plastic interpretation of India’s Taj Mahal is an ode to travel and fantasy. Built in the early seventeenth century by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, the white marble Taj Mahal is an icon of Indo-Islamic architecture and widely considered a monument to romantic love. Banerjee’s bright pink *Take me, take me, take me . . . to the Palace of love* (2003), constructed with plastic Saran wrap, is an excessively sentimental and kitschy representation of India that revolves around a critique of the colonial gaze and the ongoing exoticism perpetrated by the tourist economy. Further, its color and ornamentation represent the complex ritual of marriage—both a marker of love and an exchange of value, like money and power.[^1] Banerjee used the color pink for its theatricality; as the artist described, the color “can make one feel vulnerable, luxurious, sentimental, nostalgic, tender, comical, sudden, centered, or even, idealistic.” But there’s a darker side too that speaks to “repression, oppression, submission, omission, struggle, cruelty, the abject, and the inhumanity of amusement.”[^2]
