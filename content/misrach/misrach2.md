Richard Misrach has been photographing the desert since the mid-1970s, drawn by its particular “role in determining a peculiarly American identity and mythology.”[^1] In *Normandy Wall Near Ocotillo, California* (2015), the border wall between the United States and Mexico cuts across the landscape like a crudely stitched wound. The style of X-shaped fencing takes its name from barricades constructed on the beaches of Normandy, France, during World War II. Designed to impede vehicles, the fence here does little to prevent pedestrians from entering the country. As Misrach explained, “these walls are a way of asserting a feeling of sovereignty. . . . In this day of the Internet, of Ebola, of global capitalism, the traditional notion of the nation-state \[isn’t\] holding up anymore. So, the wall is actually a futile attempt to assert that, but it doesn’t work . . . these walls cost four to twelve million dollars a mile to build; people scale them in a minute.”[^2]
