There is an economy to Tim Hawkinson’s work. While his handmade, cobbled-together machines don’t appear sleekly efficient, the artist’s recycled materials and use of his own body as a source of investigation are notably utilitarian. In the motorized self-portrait *Emoter* (2000), a hydraulic mechanism that receives electronic signals from light sensors responding to broadcast programming on a nearby television screen to move loosely arranged fragments of a photograph of the artist’s face.[^1] As the artist states: “I can’t make most of these faces myself. It’s using my face because that’s readily available, I have exclusive rights to my face . . . it seems just honest to use my own face. . . . Sometimes the manipulation is really slight, depending on what’s coming through the TV channel. When there’s a sporting event with lots of activity, the face can be pretty emotional.”[^2] While Hawkinson’s body figures prominently in his work and even in his materials—*Bird* (1997) is a two-inch-tall bird skeleton made of the artist’s fingernail clippings—his examinations are not self-reflective introspection. Rather, they suggest a “sacramental energy,” the employment “of himself *in extremis* to his work.”[^3]
