Drawings, paintings, sculpture, video, and sound make up Tim Hawkinson’s unconventional and wide-ranging practice. Working primarily with imagery of the body and mechanical devices, the artist explores themes of corporeality, spirituality, and mortality in diverse works such as skeletal ink impressions of his own body, timepieces, and *Signature* (1993), an automated machine that signs the artist’s name. A kind of mad scientist or tinkerer,[^2] Hawkinson explores the human form and machines by “converting and reconstituting commonplace things into objects of wonderment.”[^3] Drawn to found and reclaimed objects—the artist’s parents owned an antique shop[^4]—like eggshells, fingernails, feathers, or discarded cardboard, Hawkinson’s materials lend themselves to the surreal quality of his work, in which “reality is broken down into pieces and then rebuilt.”[^5]

Tim Hawkinson is a collector of musical instruments. While not a musician, he likes “that these little objects have a voice and can be manipulated.”[^6] The artist’s best-known installation, *Überorgan* (2000), is a colossal music machine: a system of plastic bags, ducts, and pipes that inflates, bellowing to the score of a player piano. Forced air rushes through metal horn-shaped funnels and several miles of plastic sheeting that form large balloons and extensive tubes snaking through multiple rooms. Covering the square footage of a football field, it breathes and groans like a living organism. The organ is at once an instrument and a gargantuan system of entrails. Hawkinson, who is interested in the logic of systems of both humans and machines, is drawn to “interference patterns—the way overlapping patterns can create another pattern or rhythm.”[^7]

The mind-body relationship—that distinctive network between our consciousness and our corporeal being—is at the center of Tim Hawkinson’s work.[^8] *Scout* (2006–07), a *nearly six-foot-tall headless human figure, is a humorous and strange* portrait that proportionally registers the average brain’s attention to senses in different parts of the body, so the hands, feet, and genitals are disproportionately giant. Typical of Hawkinson’s eccentric aesthetic, *Scout*’s skin is made of cardboard boxes from the garment factory adjacent to the artist’s Los Angeles studio, stitched together. A kind of Frankenstein monster made of everyday material, *Scout* reflects the nature of our being—a bodily map reflecting the human mind.

There is an economy to Tim Hawkinson’s work. While his handmade, cobbled-together machines don’t appear sleekly efficient, the artist’s recycled materials and use of his own body as a source of investigation are notably utilitarian. In the motorized self-portrait *Emoter* (2000), a hydraulic mechanism that receives electronic signals from light sensors responding to broadcast programming on a nearby television screen to move loosely arranged fragments of a photograph of the artist’s face.[^9] As the artist states: “I can’t make most of these faces myself. It’s using my face because that’s readily available, I have exclusive rights to my face . . . it seems just honest to use my own face. . . . Sometimes the manipulation is really slight, depending on what’s coming through the TV channel. When there’s a sporting event with lots of activity, the face can be pretty emotional.”[^10] While Hawkinson’s body figures prominently in his work and even in his materials—*Bird* (1997) is a two-inch-tall bird skeleton made of the artist’s fingernail clippings—his examinations are not self-reflective introspection. Rather, they suggest a “sacramental energy,” the employment “of himself *in extremis* to his work.”[^11]
