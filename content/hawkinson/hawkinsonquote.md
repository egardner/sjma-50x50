“I use my image or my body in a lot of the work as a jumping-off point. But usually the end result is so abstracted that I don’t really feel so identified with it any longer. It’s not about my identity . . . it’s about our identity and our experiences within our bodies, and our bodies’ relationship to the external world.”

—Tim Hawkinson[^1]
