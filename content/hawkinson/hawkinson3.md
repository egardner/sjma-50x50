The mind-body relationship—that distinctive network between our consciousness and our corporeal being—is at the center of Tim Hawkinson’s work.[^1] *Scout* (2006–07), a *nearly six-foot-tall headless human figure, is a humorous and strange* portrait that proportionally registers the average brain’s attention to senses in different parts of the body, so the hands, feet, and genitals are disproportionately giant. Typical of Hawkinson’s eccentric aesthetic, *Scout*’s skin is made of cardboard boxes from the garment factory adjacent to the artist’s Los Angeles studio, stitched together. A kind of Frankenstein monster made of everyday material, *Scout* reflects the nature of our being—a bodily map reflecting the human mind.
