>I am always aware whatâ€™s happening in this society. And if there is a significant event like 9/11 or a shuttle exploded just recently, I like to introduce those social and cultural events in my painting. . . . \[M\]y painting is definitely based on real life and fantasy. I weave through opposite forms . . . eventually I can orchestrate a visual symphony.[^1]
