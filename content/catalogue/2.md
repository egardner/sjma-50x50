*Impression, Sunrise* (*Impression, soleil levant*) is a painting by Claude
Monet. Shown at what would later be known as the “Exhibition of the
Impressionists” in April 1874, the painting is attributed to giving rise to the
name of the Impressionist movement. *Impression, Sunrise* depicts the port of Le
Havre, Monet’s hometown, and is his most famous painting of the harbor.
