Hair is an important personal and cultural symbol in Alison Saar’s work. For the artist, who is often mistaken for white, “it was always a struggle to have my African American heritage recognized. . . . the only part of me that really reflected that was my hair.”[^1] In her human-scaled installation *Coup* (2006), a woman sits in a chair, her hair woven into a ten-foot-long braid behind her that is tethered to a stack of suitcases. The word “coup” describes a successful, aggressive move (as in *coup de grâce*, a “blow of mercy” to put another out of their misery[^2]) and is derived from *couper*, French for “to cut.” Grasping a pair of scissors in her hands, Saar’s figure is positioned to unburden herself of the baggage. When she made *Coup*, the artist’s two children had reached adolescence and were leaving home; she was also letting go of certain signature imagery in her artwork.[^3] *Coup* was first shown in an exhibition of the same name at LA Louver in Venice, California, where Saar placed another work nearby; *Proclamation* (2006), a long bronze braid severed and nailed to the wall, suggests that freedom comes with sacrifice.
