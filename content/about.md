In celebration of its fiftieth anniversary, the San José Museum of Art (SJMA) developed the digital publication *50X50: Stories of Visionary Artists from the Collection*, highlighting fifty artists whose work has entered the permanent collection. This publication shows the Museum’s support of artists as visionary thinkers and helps transform SJMA into a museum for the twenty-first century.

*50X50: Stories of Visionary Artists from the Collection* provides free worldwide access to a selection of multimedia materials that describe the lifelong work of SJMA’s modern and contemporary artists. Documentation of artworks, exhibitions, and studios engages readers in their professional as well as everyday lives, their ideas, and their creative processes.

This open-access publication is available for free online and in multiple formats for download, including PDF and EPUB.
