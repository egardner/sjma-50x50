In celebration of its 50th anniversary, the San José Museum of Art (SJMA) is developing a digital publication titled *50X50: Face to Face*, highlighting fifty artists whose work has entered the permanent collection in the last fifty years. This digital publication will show the Museum’s support of artists as visionary thinkers and help transform SJMA into a museum for the 21st century.

*50X50: Face to Face* will provide free worldwide access to a selection of multimedia materials that describe the lifelong work of SJMA’s modern and contemporary artists. Documentation of artworks, exhibitions, and studios will engage readers in their professional lives, as well as their everyday lives, their ideas, and their creative processes.
