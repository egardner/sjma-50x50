Welcome to the digital present, we are glad you found us. Maybe you are a longtime supporter of San José Museum of Art. Maybe you are a scholar or student, a curious art lover, or a Ruth Asawa devotee. What is certain is that you did not stumble upon this publication, which offers unique open access to [**SJMA**](https://sjmusart.org)’s permanent collection for the first time in a bookstore or gift shop. However you discovered this catalog, we are glad you could join us.

The San José Museum of Art is a regional modern and contemporary art museum located squarely in the Capital of Silicon Valley, and the innovative ethos of this region informs who we are and whom we serve—locally and globally. The Museum’s recent strategic plan states two goals: to become a borderless museum, essential to creative life throughout the region’s diverse communities, and to re-imagine ourselves as a museum for the audience of the future. With our neighboring tech innovation partners, we are guided by the belief that creativity and access are shared values that transcend disciplines.

With these ideas in mind, and in celebration of the Museum’s 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary, ***50X50: Stories of Visionary Artists from the Collection, a Digital Publication on the 50<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of San José Museum of Art*** offers a dynamic and web-based version of a traditional permanent collection publication. Such catalogs are important because they reveal the history of a museum’s collection over time, positioning it as a legacy, a gift to the public. 50X50 spotlights the strengths of SJMA’s collection, including significant holdings of work by California artists of national and international significance; artwork in new media and emerging fields; art that thematically addresses pressing cultural, political and social issues; and work by artists who embrace new representational strategies in the Digital Age. The digital format of this publication—SJMA’s first devoted entirely to the permanent collection—brings the stories of fifty artists to life in a free, virtual format that supports the Museum’s commitment to equity and access. It also offers a rich, engaging way to share the depth and diversity of our collection, for it conveys the lives of artists, beyond the objects, through multimedia materials, photographic assets, archival ephemera, and linked citations in addition to incisive curatorial context.

“**Open scholarship**”— an emerging framework of scholarly research and publishing that encompasses open access—is another critical element of digital publishing, which creates unrestricted access to knowledge, data, and resources, and promotes the exchange of ideas. We are indebted to the generosity and vision of the Digital Publishing division at Getty Publications, in particular, Greg Albers and Kara Kirk for their invitation to execute this project with **Quire**-- a new web publishing platform that allows 50 X 50 to be optimized for discoverability, longevity, and flexibility in the output formats.

We launch this publication from prolonged and fraught physical isolation, as we shelter in place to fight the global COVID 19 pandemic. But we are not disconnected or alone. There has been no greater time to launch a digital publication – accessible to people all over the world and flexible enough to adapt to a rapidly changing artistic landscape.
