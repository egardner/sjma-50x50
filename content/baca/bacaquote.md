>I am a painter. I love painting. Paint to me is like magic . . . it’s liquid light. . . . \[But\] painting for me has never been enough. It has always been those interactive processes that determine what I paint and how I painted and who I painted with, and whether I paint at all. All of that is about the process that is created to make that work.
