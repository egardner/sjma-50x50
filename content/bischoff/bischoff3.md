Elmer Bischoff rendered his figurative paintings from memory, rather than painting directly from models. Clusters of gestrual brushwork dissolve forms without defined edges, creating atmospheric—almost dreamlike—compositions. As Bischoff described: “Light and color were paramount as expressive content and also as organizational elements. . . . I guess this could represent some kind of rebellion against my early schooling where ‘organization’ of a painting was alwatys seen as an organization of countours, a continuity and relatedness of edges.”[^1] Light and color wash over his paintings like a kind of gauzy haze, so as to evoke emotion rather than the formal nature of his subject, or as art critic Donald Kuspit wrote, “dissolv\[ing\] tangible facts into intangibles of feeling.”[^2]
