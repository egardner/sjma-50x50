Installation view of Hito Steyerl’s *City of Broken Windows* (2019) in *Uncanny Valley: Being Human in the Age of AI,* de Young Museum, San Francisco, 2020.

Examining human relationships with artificial intelligence (AI)—a looming technology still in its infancy—Hito Steyerl asks, “does AI have a shadow?” She speculates that shadows can exist even when the object casting them is not yet visible.[^1] For example, for her 2019 work *City of Broken Windows,* Steyerl filmed engineers in the UK smashing hundreds of windows in a large airplane hangar to teach artificial neural networks how to recognize the sound of breaking glass. Destruction, in this case, is used as a mode of progress in the development of security technologies—one Steyerl sees reflected in the tech industry’s economic impact on places like California’s Bay Area, where extreme inequality emerges as a kind of shadow, a forecast of technological futures.[^2]
