The San José Museum of Art organized the first major retrospective of Robert Colescott’s paintings in 1987. Curated by Lowery Stokes Sims, who was then Associate Curator of Twentieth-Century Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, *Robert Colescott: A Retrospective, 1975–1986* highlighted the irony and humor of his increasingly expressive style. Beginning in 1975 Colescott appropriated Western art history paintings with the primary objective of putting black people into art history,[^1] as in his remake of Emanuel Leutze’s 1851 history painting of George Washington leading troops across the Delaware River. In *George Washington Carver Crossing the Delaware: Page from an American History Textbook* (1975), Carver, the famous African American scientist, takes the place of the Revolutionary War general, his troops a raucous boat full of Jim Crow–era stereotypes of African Americans—barefoot buffoons, mammies, cooks, and a banjo player.[^2] With a sharp edge Colescott used token representations and minstrel-like caricatures, the very images of blackness created by white culture to turn appropriation on its head: “the reformulated art object serves as a code by which society reveals itself.”[^3]
