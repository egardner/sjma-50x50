**Vietnam to Hollywood**

As a Vietnamese immigrant growing up in Southern California, Dinh Q. Lê watched Hollywood films to learn English. Though he tried to avoid Vietnam War films, epics like *The Deer Hunter* (1978), *Platoon* (1986), and *Born on the Fourth of July* (1989) inundated the big screen and the American consciousness; as Lê recalls, the iconic film *Apocalypse Now* (1979) “left an indelible image of Southeast Asia on the world.”[^1] Drawing upon characters from such films, Lê interlaced Hollywood portrayals of Vietnam with anonymous portraits and documentary images from the war in photo-weavings such as *Untitled (Man Carrying Person)* (2003), an example from his series “From Vietnam to Hollywood.” He scanned and printed photographs on a large scale, then cut vertical and horizontal strips that he wove together using a simple technique for hand-weaving grass mats the artist learned from an aunt when he was young. Functioning much like memory, the textured weavings reveal certain aspects of the images and obscure others. They overlay “personal memories, media-influenced memories, and Hollywood-fabricated memories to create a surreal landscape memory that is neither fact nor fiction.”[^2]
