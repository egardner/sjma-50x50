Through multiple projections and screens situated in various spatial configurations—as in the monitors arranged lying on the floor in *Untitled (Butterfly Videowall \#2)* (2008)—Diana Thater’s video art installations shift viewing perspectives to change the way we experience video in relation to space. In her early work, the artist was interested in deconstructing the basic components of video by dividing images into red, green, and blue, the primary colors of light;[^1] as the artist says, “once you find the limitations of the language, you can exceed them.”[^2] In *Untitled (Butterfly Videowall \#2)*, Thater breaks apart the wall of monitors that would together show a comprehensive image; placing them upturned on the floor, they mimic the position of monarch butterflies resting on the ground at the El Rosario Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary, the preservation site in Mexico where the video was shot. Seen at our feet, their fractured images of a butterfly slowly flapping its wings alter how viewers see dimensionality in video, suggesting that the experience of space, like images, is constructed.
