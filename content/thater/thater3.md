For Diana Thater, the world of animals suggests alternative models of spatial realities from the gravity-bound human perspective.[^1] Her video installation *Delphine* (1999) features a pod of free dolphins as they twist and dive in three-dimensional movement through the depths of the ocean and breaks through its surface. Images projected at various angles wrap around corners of the gallery and bend onto the ceiling and floor. The installation itself, overlaying the constraints of human architecture with a volumetric space, is informed by the way dolphins interact with their environment. Breaking from the conventional filming of animals, in which the camera is an extension of a voyeuristic viewer,[^2] in Thater’s framing the artist and viewer look through, not at, the animal world.[^3]
