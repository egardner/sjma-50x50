**Jitish Kallat**

India, b. 1974

At once dynamic and dysfunctional, the city is a heady mix of languages, castes, religions, and class difference. . . . Contradictions and chaos often procreate culture. The contradictions and chaos of Mumbai become coordinates for me to position the vital themes of my practice . . . hope, survival, and mortality.[^1]
