Time is a recurring theme in Jitish Kallat’s artwork, evoking ancestry, the history of the Indian subcontinent, ideas about survival and mortality, and daily acts of living. Its cycles are expansive and fractal: every breath is a unit that punctuates a lifetime. Kallat’s *Event Horizon (the hour of the day of the month of the season)* (2014) documents a mundane panoramic cityscape in a rainbow-hued lenticular print. The image shifts as the viewer changes position such that the same figures appear and reappear in different panels. Multiple timeframes are caught in a single image as if to suggest that history replays itself. Kallat’s idea that “embodied cognition,” or the awareness of oneself in space, “is central to really thinking about the world”[^1] seems at play here, suggesting that one’s position in space places them in both a single moment and an expansive history.
