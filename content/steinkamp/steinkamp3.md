In Jennifer Steinkamp’s media installations, the spectator often becomes an element within the work.[^1] For *Winter Fountains* (2017), an outdoor installation along Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Steinkamp was inspired by the street’s twentieth-century fountains to develop a kind of media “fountain”—a spectacle of light and moving images projected onto four large fiberglass domes around which passersby gather. As people approach, their “skin becomes a canvas”[^2] for her otherworldly digital animations. Their bodies are transfigured in space among colliding ice particles, floating floral forms, and bolts of lightning, which allude to the legacy of Benjamin Franklin.
