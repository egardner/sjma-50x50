Jennifer Steinkamp’s large-scale installations often cast the viewer’s shadow onto projected animations of abstract loops and grids, or digitally rendered stylized flowers and plants. They invite us to enter physically engaging aesthetic experiences that dissolve the boundary between viewer and object. She studied experimental animation at the California Institute of Technology with Gene Youngblood, author of the influential book *Expanded Cinema* (1970), who introduced her to computer-generated animation and structuralist film.[^2] Looking to early experimental, nonnarrative filmmaking—like Paul Sharits’s sensory-assaulting color flicker films and Michael Snow’s dual-sided projections[^3]—that reveal the structure of their presentation, Steinkamp’s projections alert the viewer to their own physical presence within a space: “when you walk through it you disrupt the illusion and weave yourself into the work.”[^4]

*Fly to Mars (no. 1)* (2004) is part of a computer-animated series of projections by the artist depicting hyperreal trees that twist and bend. Without beginning or end, they cycle through the seasons, bearing colorful blossoms then lush summer leaves and russet fall colors before losing their foliage. Influenced by experimental film, which often uses repetition rather than a storyline to focus viewer attention on film’s materiality rather than its content alone, Jennifer Steinkamp features the trees without narrative. Instead, their movement is abstract, “the motion of pattern and cycle.”[^5] The tree’s motion and changes over time imbue it with a kind of mortal energy mimicking our somatic experience of living, breathing, sleeping. They awaken sensations of our physical being, creating a “bond of sympathy”[^6] between our bodily experience and the projected image.

In Jennifer Steinkamp’s media installations, the spectator often becomes an element within the work.[^7] For *Winter Fountains* (2017), an outdoor installation along Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin Parkway, Steinkamp was inspired by the street’s twentieth-century fountains to develop a kind of media “fountain”—a spectacle of light and moving images projected onto four large fiberglass domes around which passersby gather. As people approach, their “skin becomes a canvas”[^8] for her otherworldly digital animations. Their bodies are transfigured in space among colliding ice particles, floating floral forms, and bolts of lightning, which allude to the legacy of Benjamin Franklin.

Jennifer Steinkamp uses computer graphics and three-dimensional animations to create pulsing and undulating visual fields of pattern and abstract motion that shift our perspective. Working within the architecture of buildings, her projected images reconfigure surfaces to create the illusion of passages and portals or play with doorways to render floating imagescapes; immaterial substances such as computer graphics and light manifest as corporeal. In *one saw; the other saw* (2001), a light and sound installation at Rice University Art Gallery on which she collaborated with the composer Jimmy Johnson, a projection on the gallery’s glass-front wall created the illusion of three dimensionality from both the interior and exterior of the space. “I use light to dematerialize architecture,” says Steinkamp.[^9] Using sensors to detect the movement of passersby, the projected image shifted in response to the viewer’s point of view so that the architecture itself seemed to be moving.[^10] Such motion-filled environments defy architecture’s space and material structure to induce visceral responses that border on vertigo and alter one’s mental state.
