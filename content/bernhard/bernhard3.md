Like classical sculpture, Ruth Bernhard’s nude photography attempts a kind of universal statement. Emphasizing shape and line through composition and light, it was a meditation on the beauty and strength of the human body. The first nude photograph Bernhard took was a spontaneous work; the Museum of Modern Art hired her to photograph objects in the 1934 *Machine Art* exhibition for the catalog. The artist’s friend Peggy Boone was visiting one day when Bernhard was shooting a large stainless-steel bowl and summoned Boone to climb inside it. Framed in its cold steel rim, Boone’s curled-up naked body resembles an embryo.[^1] But Bernhard’s main body of work on the nude developed some twenty years later in San Francisco during the 1950s and 60s. *In the Box, Horizontal* (1962), considered a masterpiece in the history of twentieth-century photography, expands on her earlier *Embryo* (1934). Accentuating bone structure and muscle, Bernhard was a pioneer in presenting a distinctly feminine study of the female form: “Men have photographed the female nude as if she belonged to them. I photograph a woman as part of the universe.”[^2]
