Louise Nevelson made her monumental *Sky Cathedral* (1957)—now in the San José Museum of Art’s collection—for her brother, who owned the Thorndike Hotel in Rockland, Maine. One of the artist’s first monochromatic sculptures made of stacked wooden crates that would become her signature style, *Sky Cathedral* hung for ten years in the Thorndike’s lobby. American art collectors Jean and Howard Lipman acquired the piece directly from Nevelson’s brother in 1967, and their son Peter Lipman and his wife Beverly donated the work to the San José Museum of Art in 2010.
