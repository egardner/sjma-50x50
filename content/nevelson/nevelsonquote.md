**Louise Nevelson**

Russia/United States, 1899–1988

“If you paint a thing black or you paint a thing white, it takes on a whole different dimension. The white and the black invite different forms. A state of mind enters into it. . . . For me, the black contains the silhouette, the essence of the universe. But the whites move out a little bit into outer space with more freedom.”[^1]
