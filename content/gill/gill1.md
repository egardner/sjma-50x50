As an art student in India, Gauri Gill trained as a painter, earning a BFA in applied art from the Delhi College of Art in 1992. She studied photography in New York at the Parsons School of Design, earning a second BFA in 1994. The artist worked for five years as a photojournalist for a news magazine, slowly developing a way of working intimately with her subject. “I feel like part of my job as a photographer is just to listen,”[^1] said Gill, whose work represents those who live on the margins due to race, ethnicity, or class.
