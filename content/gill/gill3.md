When the Urmul Setu Sansthan, a non-governmental organization in the village of Lunkaransar in Rajasthan, invited Gauri Gill to participate in a *balika mela* (a fair for girls) in 2003, she developed an entirely new way of collaborative working. Gill reimagined the role of the *photo wallah*—an itinerant portrait photographer who historically traveled to fairs and villages in India selling family portraits and identification cards. She set up a makeshift photo tent with props and backdrops at the fair for anyone to have their portrait taken and later receive a silver gelatin print. “Girls came in and decided how and with whom they wanted to be photographed,” described Gill.[^1] “We would start to discuss where and how the picture would be taken: which backdrop, what props to use, if any. The whole scene was co-directed by me and those in the pictures, as well as everyone around us.”[^2] When the fair was held again in 2010, Gill returned to show the original *balika mela* images she had taken and took additional portraits—this time in color, with a focus on the young girls’ idiosyncratic fashion, portraying the hybrid cultural reality of globalized rural India.
