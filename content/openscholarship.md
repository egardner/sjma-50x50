Digital publishing presents a new and exciting opportunity for the San José Museum of Art to further its mission of becoming a borderless museum. SJMA is an educational institution dedicated to engaging diverse communities in California’s Silicon Valley and around the world in the transformative power of art. Digital publishing is a catalyst for expanding the reach of the museum’s educational resources. Older models of museum scholarship such as the printed monograph and collection highlights catalog are designed to be shelf- ready and self-contained objects, whereas new models of fluid multimedia content published to the worldwide web foster innovation in scholarly production and also in the design of interfaces that allow readers to interact with, use, and share content in unprecedented ways. SJMA is actively experimenting with the tools of digital publishing because of this capacity to engage and cultivate diverse knowledge communities via the public internet near and far.

The Association of Research Libraries, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, DC comprised of 125 research libraries at institutions in Canada and the United States, advances the term “open scholarship” to describe an emerging framework of scholarly research and publishing that encompasses open access, open data, open educational resources, and all other forms of openness in the scholarly and research environment that are changing the way that knowledge is created and shared.

SJMA is exploring and building upon the framework of open scholarship in the digital publication 50X50 Face to Face, recognizing the potential of an inclusive non-commercial platform for cultivating diverse knowledge communities while also demonstrating an ongoing commitment to artist rights and especially the attribution of authorship for original creative works. The crux of SJMA’s approach to open scholarship is to make research widely accessible and usable without compromising the core ethical principles of the art world and established best practices for copyright law and fair use.

To this end, the production of *50X50: Stories of Visionary Artists from the Collection (50X50)* includes:

- An archive of outreach letters addressed to community partners requesting permission to make multimedia materials (over 400 items) available worldwide and for free in a web-based format

- Linked citations that honor the origins of the publication’s fluid multimedia content as well as the established relationships among artists and with journalists, curators, historians, galleries, museums, and archives

- Curatorial selection and in-house scholarly commentary about the multimedia content that is contributing and “transformative” to the original material, adding “something new, with a further purpose or different character”—as the Supreme Court put in it in Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, 510

U.S. 569 (1994) and as CAA published in its Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for the Visual Arts (February 2015)—by sequencing the materials into a relatable narrative about the life and work of featured artists in SJMA’s permanent collection with an emphasis on art’s contribution to civil society

- Linked social media platforms for sharing the publication’s multimedia content back out to the world, with the exception of materials that community partners have stipulated must not be shared beyond the SJMA publication itself

In published *50X50* as an experiment in digital publishing and open scholarship, SJMA joins other reputable and forward-thinking institutions with public service missions who have expressed a bold commitment to the open and broad dissemination of collections, resources, and scholarship motivated by problems of social inequality caused by restricting access to knowledge production and exchange.
