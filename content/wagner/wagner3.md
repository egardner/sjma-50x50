Though Catherine Wagner has no formal training in science, her methodologies are similar to the scientific approach of creating knowledge through observation and classification. She typically works with large-format view cameras, as the film size—8 x 10 inches—allows for extremely high resolution, beyond what the human eye can see.[^1] To move in closer and closer on her subjects, Wagner collaborates with scientific laboratories and uses the scanning electron microscope to create hyperreal images of objects under scientific research. The surface scan of a shark’s tooth in *Shark’s Tooth* (2000) shows a rich topography—a landscape that is at once real but eerily outside of our sensing capacities.
