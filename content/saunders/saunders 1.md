**Educator at Heart**

Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Raymond Saunders became interested in art in the first grade, and his talent was recognized at a young age. He regularly saw exhibitions at the Carnegie Museum of Art and has said that his detailed memory of those early experiences informs his painting. Before earning his BFA from Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1960, he received a scholarship to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts and also studied at the Barnes Foundation.[^1] The rigor of his own education instilled in Saunders a commitment to education—a responsibility to share his learnings through teaching. In 1960 he moved to Oakland, California—where he completed an MFA in 1961 at California College of Arts and Crafts (now the California College of the Arts)—and in1968 took a faculty position at California State University East Bay in Hayward, drawn by its diverse student body. For Saunders, the exchange with his students “is vital” and keeps him “staying in the process of learning.”[^2]
