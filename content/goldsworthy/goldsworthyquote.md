**Andy Goldsworthy**

England/Scotland, b. 1956

I am not an artist born full of things I want to express. I’m empty, hungry, wanting to know more. That’s my true self; and my art is a way of learning in which instincts guide best. It is also very physical—I need the shock of touch, the resistance of place, materials, and weather, the Earth as my source. It is a collaboration, a meeting point between my own and Earth’s nature.[^1]
