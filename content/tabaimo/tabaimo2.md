**Japan Inside Out**

In her fantastical room-sized video animations, Tabaimo probes the depths of the unconscious and gives shape to the uncertainties that haunt contemporary experience. For *dolefullhouse *(2007) she merged the miniature and the natural to create an utterly bizarre world: a** **doll house represents a Japanese body invaded by Western culture, symbolized by bourgeois furnishings and the limbs of an octopus. In the video disembodied hands arrange rooms in an intimate, comfortable** **Western style until flailing tentacles assault the home like a virus invading a body, triggering a frightening physicality of veins pulsating to the sound of a heartbeat. The hands grow restless, scratching themselves and then the walls of the house, upending its contents in the process. Eventually, a water leak turns into a flood, exposing the “guts” of the home—a heart and brain. The flooded house is a metaphor for the complexities of maintaining Japanese identity in an increasingly global society, and water is a common theme in Tabaimo’s work—as the artist explained, “the coming and going of water is a way of envisioning a world beyond this one.”[^1]
