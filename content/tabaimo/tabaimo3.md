Tabaimo’s computer-animated works bridge Japanese tradition and modernity. Starting with hundreds or even thousands of manga-like line drawings made with calligraphy pens, her soft shading and coloration recall that of *ukiyo-e* woodblock prints.[^1] Indeed, her early influences include authors of the horror manga genre, Junji Ito and Kazuo Umeda, and the discovery of a book of nineteenth-century *ukiyo-e* prints by Hokusai (1760–1849).[^2] Tabaimo’s drawings are scanned into digital files and animated with computer software. The process—aided by the artist’s studio assistant: her younger sister, Imoimo— involves combining discrete drawings into a single image, then sequencing those images on timelines to create animations projected onto setlike screens in immersive, often panoramic installations.
