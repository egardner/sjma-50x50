**History Is a Verb**

Working from photographic images of China often taken by outsiders —Western tourists or Japanese occupiers—from the nineteenth century onward, Liu “preserve\[s\] and dissolve\[s\]”[^1] histories in her drippy figurative paintings. Looking through documentary photographs, she is often drawn to details that beg questions and move her to explore through painterly abstraction, as in a photograph taken during World War II of three women in the south of China holding makeshift weapons. For *Shoah* (2006), Liu extracted the three women from the photograph and placed them like heroic warriors against a piece of lush red silk, on top of which the artist printed an enlarged documentary image of a mass grave from the Nanjing Massacre[^2]—the horrific mass murder of Chinese civilians by Japanese troops during Japan’s occupation of China. Liu’s work is both a depiction of a document and a veil of paint, resin, and silk, distilling historical detail while broadening history’s geographic and temporal terms.
