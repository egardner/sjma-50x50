“This is an image from long ago, far away . . . in a way, I have no connection with her at all. But somehow you do make a connection with your subject . . . because when you have a human figure in any photograph or painting, you always ask who is this . . . especially if you paint her face, you know, you are face to face with her.”[^1]
