Ruth Asawa’s airy, hourglass-shaped sculptures appear to float in space, though they are suspended from the ceiling. Created during the 1950s and 60s, these lobe sculptures made of crocheted wire, like *Untitled (S.035, Hanging Six-Lobed, Multilayered Interlocking Continuous Form within a Form with Spheres in the Second, Fifth, and Sixth \[Lobes), from "Group of Architectural Works"* (c. 1962), defy categorization. They evoke traditional craft, like weaving and basketmaking, but their nonutilitarian forms demonstrate an interest in abstraction; their play with positive and negative space suggest both volume and weightlessness; and their attention to line, particularly evident in the shadows they cast, approaches drawing. The biomorphic forms and dimensionality of Asawa’s sculptures can be understood through the influence of both dance and architecture at Black Mountain College, where Asawa took classes with choreographer Merce Cunningham[^1] and met her husband Albert Lanier, who was studying architecture. Though nonfigurative, the artist’s long lobe installations recall the proportions of the body and the built environment. While made up of a stable, rigid structure, their wavy and intertwining shapes are “vaguely anthropomorphic \[in the\] way they hold space, each one acting as an analogue for a human body.”[^2]
