Ruth Asawa learned how to crochet with wire from basket makers in Toluca, Mexico, where in 1947 she traveled on summer break from Black Mountain College.[^1] Upon her return, she began working with the material in a more abstract way, as a line that could interlock, interweave, and go anywhere in space: “You don’t think ahead of time, ‘this is what I want.’ You work on it as you go along. You make a line, a two-dimensional line, then you go into space, and you have a three-dimensional piece. It’s like a drawing in space.”[^2] With the simple *e*-shaped crochet loop, she could draw and sculpt simultaneously. Asawa always began from the inside out, creating orbs that seem to float within larger spheres. The outside surface of the smaller sphere folds over to become the inside surface of the sphere around it so, like a line, there is continuity.
