Ruth Asawa learned how to crochet with wire from basket makers in Toluca, Mexico, where in 1947 she traveled on summer break from Black Mountain College.[^2] Upon her return, she began working with the material in a more abstract way, as a line that could interlock, interweave, and go anywhere in space: “You don’t think ahead of time, ‘this is what I want.’ You work on it as you go along. You make a line, a two-dimensional line, then you go into space, and you have a three-dimensional piece. It’s like a drawing in space.”[^3] With the simple *e*-shaped crochet loop, she could draw and sculpt simultaneously. Asawa always began from the inside out, creating orbs that seem to float within larger spheres. The outside surface of the smaller sphere folds over to become the inside surface of the sphere around it so, like a line, there is continuity.

Ruth Asawa attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina from 1946 to 1949, studying with artist Josef Albers and architect Buckminster Fuller, whose lessons had a profound impact on her life work. At Black Mountain, teachers privileged problem solving and the process of making art as much as the final object.[^4] The school’s spirit of discipline, economy, and resourceful creativity echoed that of her upbringing during the Great Depression in Norwalk, California, a small agricultural town in Los Angeles County, where her family worked on a large-production vegetable farm. Albers instructed that all materials, no matter how common, have potential. Under his direction, her exercises in repetition, pattern, and form[^5] on paper—her attention would soon turn from paper to copper and brass wire—taught her how to allow shape to emerge from a material rather than impose predetermined ideas upon it.[^6] Meanwhile, Fuller’s ideas about the connections between design and society and his commitment to addressing basic needs like shelter, as in his geodesic dome, instilled in Asawa a belief in the continuity of the self, art, and society.[^7] With these integrated approaches to art making as a model, her practice would span from individual objects to public monuments to the Alvarado School Art Workshop—a community-based arts program Asawa started in 1968 in San Francisco public schools.

Ruth Asawa’s airy, hourglass-shaped sculptures appear to float in space, though they are suspended from the ceiling. Created during the 1950s and 60s, these lobe sculptures made of crocheted wire, like *Untitled (S.035, Hanging Six-Lobed, Multilayered Interlocking Continuous Form within a Form with Spheres in the Second, Fifth, and Sixth \[Lobes), from "Group of Architectural Works"* (c. 1962), defy categorization. They evoke traditional craft, like weaving and basketmaking, but their nonutilitarian forms demonstrate an interest in abstraction; their play with positive and negative space suggest both volume and weightlessness; and their attention to line, particularly evident in the shadows they cast, approaches drawing. The biomorphic forms and dimensionality of Asawa’s sculptures can be understood through the influence of both dance and architecture at Black Mountain College, where Asawa took classes with choreographer Merce Cunningham[^8] and met her husband Albert Lanier, who was studying architecture. Though nonfigurative, the artist’s long lobe installations recall the proportions of the body and the built environment. While made up of a stable, rigid structure, their wavy and intertwining shapes are “vaguely anthropomorphic \[in the\] way they hold space, each one acting as an analogue for a human body.”[^9]

Ruth Asawa was active in arts education and civic arts initiatives throughout her career, making several prominent public art pieces including the Japanese American Internment Memorial (1985–94) in San José. Asawa, with her family, had been interned in 1942 at a camp in Rohwer, Arkansas.[^10] She designed a narrative monument with figurative imagery to depict the history of the Japanese-American community in California before internment—stories of immigration, agriculture, small business, and culture—as well as experiences in the camps.[^11] On each end of the monument, pictorial scenes are framed by symbolic *mon*, or family crests that Asawa collected from 177 Japanese-American families in San José. Cast in two large bronze panels, it stands as a five-by-fourteen-foot double-sided monument in front of the Federal Building in downtown San José.
