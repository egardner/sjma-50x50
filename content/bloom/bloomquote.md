“I’m attracted to the enormous, important matters of life that take place on a small, everyday scale. . . . I want making art objects to be closer to giving gifts. . . . I want to make a piece that is so subtle that there’s an intimacy for the person who sees it, they will feel that I’m doing it just for them.”

—Barbara Bloom[^1]
