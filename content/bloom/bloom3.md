Barbara Bloom is drawn to fragile materials like glass and porcelain. Their breakability implies absence.[^1] They are temporal and melancholic, reminding us of our own mortality. After the artist fell out of a third-story window in 1995 and broke many bones in her body, including her vertebrae, she became interested in the Japanese tradition of repairing broken ceramics with gold lacquer. Known as *kintsugi*, this technique highlights an object’s history and flaws rather than concealing its scars.[^2] Anchored in this practice, Bloom developed a deeply personal series called *Broken* (2001) of purposefully broken and repaired ceramics and photographic works, including X-ray images of the repaired pots, paper gift boxes printed with X-ray images of the artist’s reconstructed vertebrae, and a found photograph of an acrobat balancing a stack of teapots—the precarious image framed under a sheet of shattered glass.
