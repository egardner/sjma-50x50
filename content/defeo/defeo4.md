*Jay DeFeo, Untitled*, 1971. Gelatin silver print, 4 7/8 x 4 3/4 in. Collection of the San José Museum of Art. Gift of The Jay DeFeo Foundation in honor of the Museum’s 50th Anniversary, 2019.07.

Jay DeFeo was relentlessly experimental. Her visual and poetic associations play across a remarkable array of media and material, including painting, drawing, metal sculpture, jewelry, and photography, which was a critical facet of her process. The camera’s distancing properties offered the artist new tools for focusing and framing; for manipulating tonality, perspective, and scale; and for fixating on texture. **In an untitled studio still life from 1971 of a cauliflower, egg, and mirror, DeFeo evocatively used objects to explore the thematic** continuities that transgress distinctions in subject matter and medium: **void and surface, dark and light, oval and rectangular, and rough and smooth.**
