After the emotional, physical, and creative toll taken in making *The Rose (1958–66)*, Jay DeFeo famously rested for a period. The camera facilitated her return to artmaking*.* In 1970 she began using photography as a tool to “sharpen” her perception of a work in progress, creating “visual diaries” that documented intermediate iterations along the way.[^1] She learned photography and film processing from her students at San Francisco Art Institute, where she taught painting and drawing classes, during a period when photography was only beginning to be accepted within the fine arts. Picking up a camera did not signal a dramatic shift in DeFeo’s practice; rather, it became integral to her painting and drawing process. Photography fit in with the artist’s career-long contemplation of elemental forms, exploring mythological and symbolic links between the cosmos, objects, and the body—the “undersoul,” as her friend, Beat poet Michael McClure, termed it in his poem *Dark Brown* (1961).
