Stephanie Syjuco was born in Manila, Philippines, and grew up and San Francisco. She studied sculpture at San Francisco Institute of Art, earning a BFA in 1995, and at Stanford University, where she earned her MFA in 2005. As a young artist, she recalls that “there weren’t a lot of examples of people that looked like me that made artwork,” and she became interested in “making work that sort of reflected on that marginality.”[^1] She developed an art practice dissecting art and fashion as elitist commodity systems that hide the realities of production. Through large-scale spectacles—like a production and sales booth of counterfeit artworks at an art fair—and free online services—like compilations of open-source designs and access to copyrighted art texts—Syjuco creates public interventions within the commerce of the art world, drawing broad attention to and public investigations into economy and empire.
