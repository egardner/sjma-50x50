**Interactive Art**

Jim Campbell’s early work explored ideas about interactivity in video art. In works like ***Self Portrait (with Disturbances)* (1991–92**), which uses a video camera to record the viewer’s movement, he combined live input with prerecorded material. On a monitor, an image of the artist appears to be watching the viewer; the viewer’s own pixilated, shadow-like image moves across the screen, distorting the artist’s self-portrait. Such interactive works aim to engage the viewer in exploring their own “inner world,” as the artist said, rather than simply providing content: “This for me is the main reason that I do work that is interactive. Though it is not a medium for communicating personal content, it is a medium for instilling personal process; the process itself is occurring in the viewer’s present. This to me is the most profound aspect of interactive art.”[^1]
