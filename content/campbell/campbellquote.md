>I use rhythm to describe a lot of things . . . rhythm is really just a way of describing time or the flow of time. . . . \[By\] using a truly minimal amount of information, an event can be evoked as opposed to described. . . . Rhythm is perceived time that bypasses the analytical part of the mind . . . what’s left when you’re staring at something that you’re not looking at.[^1]
