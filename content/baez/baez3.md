There is a futuristic, otherworldly quality to much of Firelei Báez’s work, even when referencing the residue of colonial history and power. *To see beyond it and to access the places that we know outside its walls* (2015) is a self-portrait that references the artist’s earlier "Can I Pass?" (2011–13) series, only instead of depicting herself in muted skin tones, she’s rendered in neon pinks and greens, decorated with a bursting prism of light. The artist’s use of fantastical color activates a space “beyond the walls” of persistent structures of oppression. Looking at the history of “surreal mythmaking of the New World” by seventeenth-century Dutch colonists, whose imagery of the Americas—one of “cannibals, vampires, and unicorns”—shaped a narrative of otherness,[^1] Báez’s supernatural figures offer alternative representations. She directly references the mythological Ciguapa, a female trickster in Dominican folklore whose changeable appearance the artist projects upon as “a radical, fluid, and active site, standing outside the typologies outlined by Western colonization.”[^2]
