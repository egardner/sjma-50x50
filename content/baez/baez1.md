Firelei Báez was raised in Dajabón, a city in the Dominican Republic on the border with Haiti, where from a young age she witnessed the stark differences between the two countries. The lush Dominican landscape contrasted with the dried, deforested land across the Dajabón River, which serves as the border.[^1] For Báez—whose mother is Dominican and father is of Haitian decent—Haiti “remained a mystery,”[^2] despite her geographical and ancestral proximity. She often looks to the landscape and architecture—the histories and mythologies embedded with them—to explore her own diasporic narrative. As a kind of metaphor for the body, the landscape is a fluid site of memory and possibility.
