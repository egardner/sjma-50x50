**Performance Dinners**

From 1970 to 1983 Lynn *Hershman Leeson created a series of “performance dinners” in San Francisco, each one honoring a close friend; through elaborate coordinations of table setting, dinnerware, props, music, and menus, each evening became an imaginative portrait of the featured guest.*[^1] *Ceramic dishes, like Lip and Bite Cup and Small Eye Plate (both 1976), were created for each dinner. “*My plates turned the idea of eating inside out; pink protruding tongues licked edges of a salad,” described Hershman Leeson.[^2] At the time, she understood “performance” as theorized by sociologist Erving Goffman in *The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life* (1956), referring to an individual’s activities over a period of time, in the presence of a set of observers, which influence and are influenced by the observers.[^3] The viewers of these undocumented works were both spectator and agent—roles that resurface in the artist’s interactive video works.
