**Robert Arneson**

United States, 1930–1992

\[T\]here’s something about touching the clay and . . . “click” . . . there’s my thumbprint. I have now recorded my existence in the mud, and I can fire it and it’s gonna last forever. . . . \[But\] you still rely on the gods because you’re never sure what it’s gonna look like when you open the kiln door.[^1]
