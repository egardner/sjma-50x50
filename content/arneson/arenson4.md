**Toilet Manifesto**

*Funk John* (1963), a dirty white stoneware toilet with bright ooze swelling out the tank and red ceramic turds, was Robert Arneson’s first ceramic toilet. Pushing the boundaries of Marcel Duchamp’s readymade *Fountain* (1917; replica 1964, Tate Modern), Arneson declared his presence in the work through finger-pinched and pushed clay. The piece was a kind of manifesto for Arneson: “I had finally arrived at a piece of work that stood firmly on its ground. . . . It was vulgar. I was vulgar.”[^1] Like Duchamp’s *Fountain*, *Funk John* was removed from its first exhibition and eventually destroyed (one of his students bought the piece and her husband smashed it to pieces). Between 1963 and 1966, Arneson made a series of toilet-themed works, including stoneware, sketches, a painting, and a lithograph, many of which included writing and graffiti-like imagery—as in the large eye on *Untitled (Urinal)* (ca. 1963)—that became prevalent in his work.
