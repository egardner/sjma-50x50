***Bird Watching***

*Nathan Oliveira was a keen observer of* birds. The hawks and falcons that soared above the foothills near Stanford’s campus *captured the artist’s imagination. When one of Oliveira’s students gave him a* stuffed kestrel discarded from the Stanford’s ornithological collection, the artist began using it as a model, *creating realistic studies* in watercolor, gouache, and oil.[^1] He collected feathers and various species of taxidermied birds. At one point, a nest of kestrels inhabited a neighboring studio at Stanford; “One day,” described Oliveira, “while at the easel, I noticed something fly down past my shoulder and sit on the floor. It was a small kestrel, which had entered my space through an opening in the studio wall. It was exhausted, and there I stood, eyeball to eyeball, with this magnificent creature.”[^2] Beginning in 1970, Oliveira became preoccupied with raptors as a subject matter. By the 1980s, he produced increasingly abstract images of wings, which culminated in the “Windhover” paintings—a series of large-scale meditative abstractions on flight made in the 1980s and 90s.[^3]
