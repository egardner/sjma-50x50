**A Part of Nature**

Painting from a live model was more than just a formal exercise in line and light for Nathan Oliveira; it was the part of his practice that connected him across time and filled his studio with the energy of a living being. “This is about us and nature, us as a part of nature.”[^1] Indeed, painting from a live model offered a link between the artist and the history of art: “It is something artists have shared over centuries.”[^2] The model was a spirited, not static, partner in Oliveira’s process. “I don’t seek to replicate the reality of the human figure, but to reach behind that, to a different reality born out of the language of gesture and the fluidity of the material that I use.”[^3]
