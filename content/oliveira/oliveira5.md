Nathan Oliveira envied the freedom of birds in flight, soaring high above and seemingly detached from earth. In the mid-1980s, the artist began exploring the shape of a bird wing as a metaphor for the mind: “The catenary curve can become the circular curve of the earth. I want to show how the mind can transport itself beyond the barriers of the ground.”[^1] On large canvases—the scale reflecting the grandness of their spiritual nature—Oliveira painted wings with zoological precision and vigorous brushwork, refining and abstracting the concept of flight.
