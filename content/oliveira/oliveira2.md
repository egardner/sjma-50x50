During the heyday of Abstract Expressionism in the Bay Area, Nathan Oliveira was studying figure painting. It was 1950, and he was taking a summer course with German Expressionist Max Beckmann at Mills College in Oakland. Beckmann was hugely influential on the young artist, who would recall his teacher’s primary advice: “more black.”[^1] Uninterested in current trends, “Beckmann symbolized the old world” and encouraged Oliveira to “deal with reality.”[^2] He was most enthusiastic about Oliveira’s work during class sessions with models, encouraging the development of isolated figures in atmospheric washes of paint.[^3] By the time Oliveira joined the painting faculty at California School of Fine Arts in 1956, along with Frank Lobdell and Richard Diebenkorn, Abstract Expressionism had fallen out of favor: “It was like the aftermath of a great party . . . and we all had to clean up.”[^4] There, amid “a spirit of resurrection,”[^5] Oliveira forged his own style bridging traditional figure painting with the primacy of the artist’s gesture.
