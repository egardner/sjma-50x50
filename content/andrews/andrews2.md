*Shadow Over the Land*

In his painting *Shadow Over the Land* (1966), Benny Andrews depicted a watery dreamscape filled with tiny cavorting white nudes, reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch’s *The Garden of Earthly Delights* (ca. 1504). A young black man sits hunched over, larger than his surroundings, solitary, and contemplative. Characteristic of Andrews’s work, this central figure is expressive and empathetic. Though not explicit portraits, his figures have histories and palpable emotions. As the artist explained of his practice: “Faces talk to me too. I get my painting started and this face is telling me something. . . . I look in the face and I slowly start feeling what this person is supposed to be doing and it guides me.”[^1]
