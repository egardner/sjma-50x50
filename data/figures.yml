    caption: Hung Liu was in high school when Mao Zedong launched China’s Cultural Revolution in 1966, and she heeded his order for ‘intellectual’ urban youth to resettle in the countryside to be ‘re-educated’ amongst peasants and farmers. For four years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Liu worked year-round in the fields planting corn, wheat, paddy rice, and vegetables. She recalls the wheat harvest as the hardest time of year, walking in pitch darkness and racing to pull the grain by hand before day broke and the sun beat down.
