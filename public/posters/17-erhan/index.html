    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    Artist Jonathan Borofsky (b. 1942) is famous for his large, kinetic, outdoor sculptures. This paper presents the conservation of <em>Ballerina Clown</em>, an outdoor sculpture in the Collection Museum Ludwig Forum Aachen (Germany), and gives an overview of the history, technology, and conservation of the mechanism inside the sculpture. Conservation and restoration treatments became necessary following damage due to vandalism. During the conservation process, the motion of the leg was adjusted.

</p>

<p><em>Ballerina Clown</em> (1990) by Jonathan Borofsky (b. 1942) is composed of a female ballerina body wearing a male clown mask. This “transvestite figure (half clown, half ballerina)” (<a href="#ottinger-2004" class="quire-citation"><span class="visually-hidden">Citation: </span>Ottinger 2004, 39</a><span class="quire-citation-content"><span class="quire-citation-content__no-css"> [</span>Ottinger, Didier. 2004. “The Circus of Cruelty: A Portrait of the Contemporary Clown as Sisyphus,” 35–45. In <em>The Great Parade: Portrait of the Artist as Clown</em>, by Jean Clari. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.<span class="quire-citation-content__no-css">]</span></span>) dances on top of a box in front of a curtain. The figure’s arms are outstretched, and one leg sways gently, “kicking” in the air. The work is accompanied by Frank Sinatra’s “My Way” sung in a creepy, hollow voice by Borofsky. The figure holds a “flying” golden ring and lights illuminate the kinetic sculpture at night.</p>

<p>The figure of the ballerina clown occurs several times in Borofsky’s oeuvre. The first version is a drawing from 1981 titled <em>The Entertainer (Self-portrait as Clown)</em> (Kunstmuseum Basel 1983:133, 183). The first sculpture version is the kinetic artwork <em>The Dancing Clown at 2,845,325</em> (1982–83), which is much smaller and an indoor sculpture. It is part of the collection the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (<a href="#clari-2004" class="quire-citation"><span class="visually-hidden">Citation: </span>Clari 2004, 242</a><span class="quire-citation-content"><span class="quire-citation-content__no-css"> [</span>Clari, Jean. 2004. <em>The Great Parade: Portrait of the Artist as Clown</em>. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press.<span class="quire-citation-content__no-css">]</span></span>). Around 1986 Borofsky created a couple of color and occasionally kinetic screenprints of the ballerina clown similar to the first drawing. Later Borofsky created the two final versions of the ballerina clown, which are outdoor sculptures; one, built in 1989, is in Venice, California, and a second in 1990. The 1990 version of the ballerina clown is displayed in the courtyard of the Museum Ludwig Forum Aachen, Germany (<a href="#17.1a">fig. 17.1a</a>).</p>

<p>The artwork is as high as a two-story building (about 9 × 5.7 × 6.4m) and is made from stable materials including aluminum, steel, glass fiber reinforced plastic (GRP), two-part epoxy resins, and two-part polyurethane paints. (Information on media was supplied by the artist.)</p>

<p>The motion of the leg is powered by an electric motor that rotates a flywheel. Through a coupling rod, a gearwheel with an attached chain turns back and forth, and the sculpture’s leg is moved by a second gearwheel that is installed as a “knee joint.” Both gearwheels are connected through attached chains and a steel rope. Two guide rollers determine the direction of the steel rope (<a href="#17.1b">fig. 17.1b</a>). Amplifiers, speakers, and a cassette recorder play the song, and lights illuminate the sculpture at night. The artwork can be activated by a switch in a nearby building.</p>

<h2 id="damage-and-treatments">Damage and Treatments</h2>

<p>Since 1991 <em>Ballerina Clown</em> has been exhibited in the courtyard of the Museum Ludwig Forum Aachen. Conservation and restoration treatments were necessary after it was vandalized. The mechanism that allows the clown’s leg to swing was broken, and sections of the original surface were cracked and damaged. Additionally, the paint had whitened through chalking, and partial delamination, cracks, and losses emerged.</p>

<p>When the movable leg was examined to replace the torn steel rope, it was evident that the leg swung very strongly in both directions (see <a href="#17.1b">fig. 17.1b</a>), which raised the question of whether this was the original configuration. Further inspection of the flywheel revealed that one hole had distinct traces of wear, indicating that it had been used originally. Because the hole was already very worn, it could not continue to be used. After consultation with the museum, a new hole was drilled with the same distance to the center as the original. This allows the old hole to serve as a primary document.</p>

<p>Additional treatments were performed to stabilize frail parts of the GRP, consolidate delamination, fill losses, and retouch this painted outdoor sculpture.</p>
