<p>French art consists of the visual and plastic arts (including architecture,
woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from the geographical area of
France. Modern France was the main centre for the European art of the Upper
Paleolithic, then left many megalithic monuments, and in the Iron Age many of
the most impressive finds of early Celtic art. The Gallo-Roman period left a
distinctive provincial style of sculpture, and the region around the modern
Franco-German border led the empire in the mass production of finely
decoratedAncient Roman pottery, which was exported to Italy and elsewhere on a
lagre scale. With Merovingian art the story of French styles as a distinct and
influential element in the wider development of the art of Christian Europe
begins.</p>

<p>France can fairly be said to have been a leader in the development of Romanesque
art and Gothic art, before the Italian Renaissance led to Italy replacing France
as the main source of stylistic developments until the age of Louis XIV, when
France largely regained this role, holding it until the mid-20th centur.y</p>

<p>Currently, the earliest known European art is from the Upper Palaeolithic period
of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of
extant pre- historic art from the Châtelperronian, Aurignacian, Solutrean,
Gravettian, and Magdalenian cultures. This art includes cave paintings, such as
the famous paintings at Pech Merle in the Lot in Languedoc which date back to
16,000 BC, Lascaux, located near the village of Montignac, in the Dordogne,
dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, or perhaps, as far back as 25,000
BC, the Cosquer Cave, the Chauvet Cave dating back to 29,000 BC, and the
Trois-Frères cave; and portable art, such as animal carvings and great goddess
statuettes called Venus figurines, such as the &ldquo;Venus of Brassempouy&rdquo; of 21,000
BC, discovered in the Landes, now in the museum at the Château de
Saint-Germain-en-Laye or the Venus of Lespugue at the Musée de l&rsquo;Homme.
Ornamental beads, bone pins, carvings, as well as flint and stone arrowheads
also are among the prehistoric objects from the area of France.</p>

<p>Speculations exist that onlyHomo sapiens are capable of artistic expression,
howeve,r a recent find, the Mask of La Roche-Cotard—a Mousterian or Neanderthal
artifact, found in 2002 in a cave near the banks of the Loire River, dating back
to about 33,000 B.C.— now suggests that Neanderthal humans may have developed a
sophisticated and complex artistic tradition.</p>

<p>In the Neolithic period (see Neolithic Europe), megalithic (large stone)
monuments, such as the dolmens and menhirs at Carnac, Saint-Sulpice-de-Faleyrens
and elsewhere in France begin to appear; this appearance is thought to start in
the fifth millennium BC, although some authors speculate about Mesolithic roots.
In France there are some 5,000 megalithics monuments, mainly in Brittany, where
there is the largest concentration of these monuments. In this area there is
wide variety of these monuments that have been well preserved, like menhirs,
dolmen, cromlechs and cairns. The Cairn of Gavrinis in southern Brittany is an
outstanding example of megalithic art : its 14 meters inner corridor is nearly
completely adorned with ornamental carvings. The great broken menhir of Er-Grah,
now in four pieces was more than 20 meters high originally, making it the
largest menhir ever erected. France has also numerous painted stones, polished
stone axes, and inscribed menhirs from this period. The Grand-Pressigny area was
known for its precious silex blades and they were extensively exported during
the Neolithic.</p>

<p>In France from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age, one finds a variety of
archaeological cultures, including the Rössen culture of c. 4500–4000 BC, Beaker
culture of c. 2800–1900 BC, Tumulus culture of c. 1600–1200 BC, Urnfield culture
of c. 1300–800 BC, and, in a transition to theIron Age, Hallstatt cultureof c.
1200–500 BC.</p>

<p>For more on Prehistoric sites in Western France, see Prehistory of Brittany.
Celtic and Roman periods From the Proto-Celtic Urnfield and Hallstat cultures, a
continental Iron age Celtic art developed; mainly associated with La Tène
culture, which flourished during the late Iron Age from 450 BC to the Roman
conquest in the first century BC. This art drew on native, classical and
perhaps, the Mediterranean, oriental sources. The Celts of Gaul are known
through numerous tombs and burial mounds found throughout France.</p>

<p>Celtic art is very ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally
using symmetry, without the imitation of nature nor ideal of beauty central to
the classical tradition, but apparently, often involves complex symbolism. This
artwork includes a variety of styles and often incorporates subtly modified
elements from other cultures, an example being the characteristic over-and-under
interlacing which arrived in France only in the sixth century, although it was
already used by Germanic artists. The Celtic Vix grave in present-day Burgundy
revealed the largest bronze crater of the Antiquity, that was probably imported
by Celtic aristocrats from Greece.</p>

<p>The region of Gaul (Latin: Gallia) came under the rule of the Roman Empire from
the first century BC to the fifth century AD. Southern France, and especially
Provence and Languedoc, is known for its many intact Gallo-Roman monuments.
Lugdunum, modern Lyon, was at the time of the Roman Empire the largest city
outside Italy and gave birth to two Roman Emperors. The city still boasts some
Roman remains including a Theater. Monumental works from this period include the
amphitheater in Orange, Vaucluse, the &ldquo;Maison Carrée&rdquo; at Nîmes which is one of
the best preserved Roman temples in Europe, the city of Vienne near Lyon, which
features an exceptionally well preserved temple (the temple of Augustus and
Livia), a circus as well as other remains, the Pont du Gard aqueduct which is
also in an exceptional state of preservation, the Roman cities of Glanum and
Vaison-la-Romaine, two intact Gallo-Roman arenas inNîmes and Arles, and the
Roman baths, and the arena of Paris.</p>

<h3 id="medieval-period-merovingian-art">Medieval period Merovingian art</h3>

<p>Merovingian art is the art and architecture of the Merovingian dynasty of the
Franks, which lasted from the fifth century to the eighth century in present-day
France and Germany. The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in Gaul during the
fifth century led to important changes in the arts. In architecture, there was
no longer the desire to build robust and harmonious buildings. Sculpture
regressed to being little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of
sarcophagi, altars, and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, the rise of
gold work and manuscript illumination brought about a resurgence of Celtic
decoration, which, with Christian and other contributions, constitutes the basis
of Merovingian art. The unification of the Frankish kingdom under Clovis I
(465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need to build churches. The
plans for them probably were copied from Roman basilicas. Unfortunately, these
timber structures have not survived because of destruction by fire, whether
accidental or caused by the Normans at the time of their incursions.</p>

<h3 id="carolingian-art">Carolingian art</h3>

<p>Carolingian art is the approximate 120-year period from 750 to 900—during the
reign of Charles Martel, Pippin the Younger, Charlemagne, and his immediate
heirs —popularly known as the Carolingian Renaissance. The Carolingian era is
the first period of the Medieval art movement known asPre-Romanesque. For the
first time, Northern European kings patronized classical Mediterranean Roman art
forms, blending classical forms with Germanic ones, creating entirely new
innovations in figurine line drawing, and setting the stage for the rise of
Romanesque art and, eventually, Gothic art in the West.</p>

<p>Illuminated manuscripts, metalwork, small-scale sculpture, mosaics, and frescos
survive from the period. The Carolingians also undertook major architectural
building campaigns at numerous churches in France. These include, those of Metz,
Lyon, Vienne, Le Mans, Reims, Beauvais, Verdun, Saint-Germain in Auxerre, Saint-
Pierre in Flavigny, and Saint-Denis, as well as the town center of Chartres. The
Centula Abbey of Saint-Riquier (Somme), completed in 788, was a major
achievement in monastic architecture. Another important building (mostly lost
today) was &ldquo;Theodulf&rsquo;s Villa&rdquo; in Germigny-des-Prés.</p>

<p>With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, artistic production halted for
almost three generations. After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France
split into a number of feuding provinces, lacking any organized patronage.
French art of the tenth and eleventh centuries was produced by local monasteries
to promote literacy and piety, however, the primitive styles produced were not
so highly skilled as the techniques of the earlier Carolingian period.</p>

<p>Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of
Carolingian manuscripts as models to co,paynd the availability of itinerant
artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its
abbot Odbert (986–1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and
Carolingian forms. The nearby abbey of St. Vaast (Pas-de-Calais) also created a
number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were
produced c. 1000, at the monastery of Saint Martial in Limoges, as well as at
Albi, Figeac, and Saint-Sever-de-Rustan in Gascony. In Paris a unique style
developed at the abbey of Saint- Germain-des-Prés. In Normandy a new style arose
in 975. By the later tenth century with the Cluny reform movement and a revived
spirit for the concept of Empire, art production resumed.</p>

<h3 id="romanesque-art">Romanesque art</h3>

<p>Romanesque art refers to the art of Western Europe during a period of one
hundred and fifty years, from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the Gothic
style, which arose in the middle of the twelfth century in France. &ldquo;Romanesque
Art&rdquo; was marked by a renewed interest in Roman construction techniques. For
example, the twelfth- century capitals on the cloister of
Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert, adopt an acanthus-leaf motif and the decorative use of
drill holes, which were commonly found on Roman monuments. Other important
Romanesque buildings in France include the abbey of Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire in
Loiret, the churches of Saint-Foy in Conques of Aveyron, Saint-Martin in Tours,
Saint-Philibert in Tournus of Saône-et-Loire, Saint-Remi in Reims, and
Saint-Sernin in Toulouse. In particular, Normandy experienced a large building
campaign in the churches of Bernay, Mont-Saint-Michel, Coutances Cathedral, and
Bayeux.</p>

<p>Most Romanesque sculpture was integrated into church architecture, not 1150 only
for aesthetic, but also for structural purposes. Small-scale sculpture during
the pre-Romanesque period was influenced by Byzantine and Early Christian
sculpture. Other elements were adopted from various local styles of Middle
Eastern countries. Motifs were derived from the arts of the &ldquo;barbarian,&rdquo; such as
grotesque figures, beasts, and geometric patterns, which were all important
additions, particularly in the regions north of the Alps. Among the important
sculptural works of the period are the ivory carvings at the monastery of Saint
Gall. Monumental sculpture was rarely practised separately from architecture in
the Pre-Romanesque period. For the first time after the fall of the Roman
empire, monumental sculpture emerged as a significant art form. Covered church
façades, doorways, and capitals all increased and expanded in size and
importance, as in the Last Judgment Tympanum, Beaulieu-sur- Dordogne, and the
Standing Prophet at Moissac. Monumental doors, baptismal fonts, and candle
holders, frequently decorated with scenes from biblical history, were cast in
bronze, attesting to the skills of the contemporary metalworkers. Frescoes were
applied to the vaults and walls of churches. Rich textiles and precious objects
in gold and silver, such as chalices and reliquaries, were produced in
increasing numbers to meet the needs of the liturgy, and to serve the cult of
the saints. In the twelfth century, large-scale sculpture spread throughout
Europe. In the French Romanesque churches of Provence, Burgundy, and Aquitaine,
sculptures adorned the façades and statues were incorporated into the capitals.
Gothic Gothic art and architecture were products of a Medieval art movement that
lasted about three hundred years. It began in France, developing from the
Romanesque period in the mid-twelfth century. By the late fourteenth century, it
had evolved toward a more secular and natural style known as,International
Gothic, which continued until the late fifteenth century, when it evolved
further, into Renaissance art. The primary Gothic art media weresculpture, panel
painting, stained glass, fresco, and illuminated manuscript.</p>

<p>Gothic architecture was born in the middle of the twelfth century in
Île-de-France, when Abbot Suger built the abbey at St. Denis, c. 1140,
considered the first Gothic building, and soon afterward, the Chartres
Cathedral, c. 1145. Prior to this, there had been no sculpture tradition in
Île-de-France—so sculptors were brought in from Burgundy, who created the
revolutionary figures acting as columns in the Western (Royal) Portal of
Chartres Cathedral (see image) —it was an entirely new invention in French art,
and would provide the model for a generation of sculptors. Other notable Gothic
churches in France include Bourges Cathedral, Amiens Cathedral, Notre-Dame de
Laon, Notre Dame in Paris, Reims Cathedral, the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris,
Strasbourg Cathedral.</p>

<p>The designations of styles in French Gothic architecture are as follows: Early
Gothic, High Gothic, Rayonnant, and Late Gothic or &ldquo;Flamboyant&rdquo;. Division into
these divisions is effective, but debatable. Because Gothic cathedrals were
built over several successive periods, and the artisans of each period not
necessarily following the wishes of previous periods, the dominant architectural
style often changed during the building of a particular building. Consequently,
it is difficult to declare one building as belonging to certain era of Gothic
architecture. It is more useful to use the terms as descriptors for specific
elements within a structure, rather than applying it to the building as a whole.
The Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral,c. 1145, these architectural
statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures, a revolution in style and the models
for a generation of sculptors The French ideas spread. Gothic sculpture evolved
from the early stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a
spatial and naturalistic treatment in the late twelfth and early thirteenth
century. Influences from surviving ancient Greek and Roman sculptures were
incorporated into the treatment of drapery, facial expression, and pose of the
Dutch-Burgundian sculptor, Claus Sluter, and the taste for naturalism first
signaled the end of Gothic sculpture, evolving into the classicistic Renaissance
style by the end of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Painting in a style that may be called, &ldquo;Gothic,&rdquo; did not appear until about
1200, nearly fifty years after the start of Gothic architecture and sculpture.
The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and by no means
clearly delineated, but one may see the beginning of a style that is more
somber, dark, and emotional than the previous period. This transition occurs
first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220, and in Italy
around 1300. Painting, the representation of images on a surface, was practiced
during the Gothic period in four primary crafts, frescos, panel paintings,
manuscript illumination, and stained glass. Frescoes continued to be used as the
main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a
continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. In the north, stained
glass remained the dominantart form until the fifteenth century. At the end of
the 14th century and during the 15th century French princely courts like
those of the dukes of Burgundy, the duke of Anjou or the duke of Berry as well
as the pope and the cardinals in Avignon employed renowned painters, like the
Limbourg Brothers, Barthélemy d&rsquo;Eyck, Enguerrand Quartonor Jean Fouquet, who
developed the so-called International Gothicstyle that spread through Europe and
incorporated the new Flemish influence as well as the innovations of the Italian
early Renaissance artists.</p>

<h3 id="early-modern-period">Early Modern period</h3>

<p>In the late fifteenth century, the French invasion of Italy and the proximity of
the vibrant Burgundy court, with its Flemish connections, brought the French
into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the Northern
and Italian Renaissance. Initial artistic changes at that time in France were
executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as Jean Clouet and his son
François Clouet, along with the Italians, Rosso Fiorentino, Francesco
Primaticcio, and Niccolò dell&rsquo;Abbate of what is often called the first School of
Fontainebleau from 1531. Leonardo da Vinci also was invited to France by
François I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced
little for the French king.</p>

<p>The art of the period from François I through Henri IV often is heavily inspired
by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as
Mannerism, which is associated with Michelangelo and Parmigianino, among others.
It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon
visual rhetoric, including the elaborate use of allegory and mythology. Perhaps
the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of
the Châteaux of the Loire Valley. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such
pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the
Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.</p>

<p>The seventeenth century marked a golden age for French art in all fields. In the
early part of the seventeenth century, late mannerist and early Baroque
tendencies continued to flourish in the court of Marie de Medici and Louis XIII.
Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the
Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the Counter-Reformation.
Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of Peter Paul Rubens
with his the Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to Nicolas Poussin
with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicism. Another proponent of
classicism working in Rome was Claude Gellée, known as Le Lorrain, who defined
the form of classical landscape.</p>

<p>Many young French painters of the beginning of the century went to Rome to train
themselves and soon assimilated Caravaggio&rsquo;s influence like Valentin de Boulogne
and Simon Vouet. The later is credited with bringing the baroque in France and
at his return in Paris in 1627 he was named first painter of the king. But
French painting soon departed from the extravagance and naturalism of the
Italian baroque and painters like Eustache Le Sueur and Laurent de La Hyre,
following Poussin example developed a classicist way known as &ldquo;Parisian
atticism&rdquo;, inspired by Antiquity, and focusing on proportion, harmony and the
importance of drawing. Even Vouet, after his return from Italy, changed his
manner to a more measured but still highly decorative and elegant style.</p>

<p>But at the same time there was still a strong Caravaggisti school represented in
the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of Georges de La Tour. The
wretched and the poor were featured in a quasi-Dutch manner in the paintings by
the three Le Nain brothers. In the paintings of Philippe de Champaigne there are
both propagandistic portraits of Louis XIII&rsquo; s minister Cardinal Richelieu and
other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic Jansenist sect. In
architecture, architects like Salomon de Brosse, François Mansart and Jacques
Lemercier helped define the French form of the baroque, developing the formula
of the urban hôtel particulier that was to influence all of Europe and strongly
departed from the Italian equivalent, the palazzo. Many aristocratic castles
were rebuilt in the new classic- baroque style, some of the most famous being
Maisons and Cheverny, characterized by high roofs &ldquo;à la française&rdquo; and a form
that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers.</p>

<p>From the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to
by the term &ldquo;Classicism&rdquo; which implies an adherence to certain rules of
proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in
southern and eastern Europe during the same period. Under Louis XIV, the Baroque
as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as
Bernini&rsquo;s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.

<p>Through propaganda, wars, and great architectural works, Louis XIV launched a
vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The Palace
of Versailles, initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was
transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties, under
the direction of architects Louis Le Vau (who had also built the château de
Vaux-le-Vicomte) and Jules Hardouin Mansart (who built the church of the
Invalides in Paris), painter and designer Charles Le Brun, and the landscape
architect André Le Nôtre who perfected the rational form of the French garden
that from Versailles spread in all of Europe.</p>

<p>For sculpture Louis XIV&rsquo;s reign also proved an important moment thanks to the
King&rsquo;s protection of artists like Pierre Puget, François Girardon and
Charles-Antoine Coysevox. In Rome, Pierre Legros, working in a more baroque
manner, was one of the most influential sculptors of the end of the century.</p>

<h3 id="rococo-and-neoclassicism">Rococo and Neoclassicism</h3>

<p>Rococo and Neoclassicism are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts
and architecture in Europe from the late seventeenth to the late eighteenth
centuries. In France, the death ofLouis XIV in 1715 lead to a period of freedom
commonly called the Régence. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the
young king Louis XV and the government led by the duke of Orléans residing in
Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as rocaille : the
asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is
less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality
and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and
furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters
subjects, like the &ldquo;fêtes galantes&rdquo;, theater settings, pleasant mythological
narratives and the female nude. Most of the times the moralising sides of myths
or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and
pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an
emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very
colorful scenes. Important painters from this period include Antoine Watteau,
considered the inventor of thefête galante, Nicolas Lancret and François
Boucher.</p>

<p>The Louis XV style of decoration, although already apparent at the end of the
last reign, was lighter with pastel colors, wood panels, smaller rooms, less
gilding, and fewer brocades; shells, garlands, and occasional Chinese subjects
predominated. The Chantilly, Vincennes and then Sèvres manufactures produced
some of the finest porcelain of the time. The highly skilled ébénistes,
cabinet-makers mostly based in Paris, created elaborate pieces of furniture with
precious wood and bronze ornaments that were to be highly praised and imitated
in all of Europe. The most famous are Jean-François Oeben, who created the work
desk of king Louis XV in Versailles, and Bernard II van Risamburgh. Rooms in
châteaux and hôtels particuliers were more intimate than during the reign of
Louis XIV and were decorated with rocaille style boiseries (carved wood pannels
covering the walls of a room) conceived by architects like Germain Boffrand or
ornemanistes (designers of decorative objects) likeJuste-Aurèle Meissonnier.</p>

Boffrand, Robert de Cotte and Ange-Jacques Gabriel, who designed public squares
like theplace de la Concordein Paris and the place de la Bourse in Bordeaux in a
style consciously inspired by that of the era of Louis XIV. During the first
half of the century, France replaced Italy as the artistic centre and main
artistic influence in Europe and many French artists worked in other courts
across the continent.</p>

<p>The latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in
Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the French
language was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic
system continued to produce artists, but some, such as Jean-Honoré Fragonard and
Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin, explored new and increasingly impressionist styles
of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to
be respected officially, genre painting, landscape, portrait, and still life
were extremely fashionable. Chardin and Jean-Baptiste Oudrywere hailed for their
still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in
the hierarchy of painting subjects.</p>

<p>One also finds in this period a Pre-romanticist aspect. Hubert Robert&rsquo;s images
of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect
as well as the image of storms and moonlight marines by Claude Joseph Vernet. So
too the change from the rational and geometricalFrench garden of André Le Nôtre
to the English garden, which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature.
One also finds in some of these gardens—curious ruins of temples—called
&ldquo;follies&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The middle of the eighteenth century saw a turn to Neoclassicism in France, that
is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and iconography. This
movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the
artificiality and the decorative essence of the rocaille style. In painting, the
greatest representative of this style is Jacques-Louis David, who, mirroring the
profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter
often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The
dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by Nicolas
Poussin in the seventeenth century. Poussin and David were in turn major
influences on Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. Other important neoclassical
painters of the period are Jean-Baptiste Greuze and Joseph-Marie Vien.
Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture.</p>

<p>Architects like Ledoux and Boullée developed a radical style of neoclassical
architecture based on simple and pure geometrical forms with a research of
simetry and harmony, elaborating visionary projects like the complex of the
Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans by Ledoux, a model of an ideal factory developed from
the rational concepts of theEnlightmentthinkers.</p>

<p>The French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars brought great changes to the arts
in France. The program of exaltation and myth making attendant to the Emperor
Napoleon I of France was closely coordinated in the paintings of David, Gros and
Guérin. Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingreswas the main figure of neoclassicism until
the 1850s and a prominent teacher, giving priority to drawing over color.
Meanwhile, Orientalism, Egyptian motifs, the tragic anti-hero, the wild
landscape, the historical novel, and scenes from the Middle Ages and the
Renaissance —all these elements ofRomanticism—created a vibrant period that
defies easy classification. The most important romantic painter of the period
was Eugène Delacroix, who had a successful public career and was the main
opponent of Ingres. Before him, Théodore Géricault opened the path to
romanticism with his monumental Raft of the Medusa exposed at the 1819 Salon.
Camille Corot tried to escape the conventional and idealized form of landscape
painting influenced by classicism to be more realist and sensible to atmospheric
variations at the same time.</p>

<p>Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century, both idealized landscape
painting and Naturalism have their seeds in Romanticism. The work of Gustave
Courbet and the Barbizon school are logical developments from it, as is the late
nineteenth century Symbolism of such painters as Gustave Moreau, the professor
of Henri Matisse and Georges Rouault, as well as Odilon Redon. Academic painting
developed at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts was the most successful with the public
and the State : highly trained painters like Jean-Léon Gérôme, William
Bouguereau and Alexandre Cabanel painted historical scenes inspired by the
antique, following the footsteps of Ingres and the neoclassics. Though
criticized for their conventionalism by the young avant-garde painters and
critics, the most talented of the Academic painters renewed the historical
genre, drawing inspiration from multiple cultures and techniques, like the
Orient and the new framings made possible by the invention of photography</p>

<p>For many critics EÉdouard Manet wrote of the nineteenth century and the modern
period (much as Charles Baudelaire does in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish
painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his
exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical brush strokes are the first
steps toward Impressionism. Impressionism would take the Barbizon school one
step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed
colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors
in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of J. M. W. Turner and
Eugène Boudin). It led to Claude Monet with his cathedrals and haystacks,
Pierre-Auguste Renoir with both his early outdoor festivals and his later
feathery style of ruddy nudes, Edgar Degas with his dancers and bathers. Other
important impressionists wereAlfred Sisley, Camille Pissarroand Gustave
Caillebotte.</p>

<p>After that threshold was crossed, the next thirty years became a litany of
amazing experiments. Vincent van Gogh, Dutch born, but living in France, opened
the road to expressionism. Georges Seurat, influenced by color theory, devised a
pointillist technique that governed the Impressionist experiment and was
followed by Paul Signac. Paul Cézanne, a painter&rsquo;s painter, attempted a
geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent.
Paul Gauguin, a banker, found symbolism in Brittany along Emile Bernard and then
exoticism and primitivism in French Polynesia. Les Nabis, a movement of the
1890s, regrouping painters such as Paul Sérusier, Pierre Bonnard, Édouard
Vuillard and Maurice Denis, was influenced by Gauguin&rsquo;s example in Brittany :
they explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a
Japanese print. They preached that a work of art is the end product and the
visual expression of an artist&rsquo;s synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic
metaphors and symbols. Henri Rousseau, the self-taught dabbling postmaste,r
became the model for the naïve revolution.</p>

<p>The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by experiments in colour
and content that Impressionism and Post-Impressionism had unleashed. The
products of the far east also brought new influences. At roughly the same time,
Les Fauves (Henri Matisse, André Derain, Maurice de Vlaminck, Albert Marquet,
Raoul Dufy, Othon Friesz, Charles Camoin, Henri Manguin) exploded into color,
much like GermanExpressionism.</p>

<p>The discovery of African tribal masks by Pablo Picasso, a Spaniard living in
Paris, lead him to create his Les Demoiselles d&rsquo;Avignon of 1907. Working
independently, Picasso and Georges Braque returned to and refined Cézanne&rsquo;s way
of rationally comprehension of objects in a flat medium, their experiments in
cubism also would lead them to integrate all aspects and objects of day-to-day
life,collage of newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine, and other
objects into their works. Cubism in all its phases would dominate paintings of
Europe and America for the next ten years. (See the article on Cubism for a
complete discussion.)</p>

<p>World War I did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group
of discontents met in a bar in Zurich, the Cabaret Voltaire, and created the
most radical gesture possible, the anti-art of Dada. At the same time, Francis
Picabia and Marcel Duchamp were exploring similar notions. At a 1917 art show
inNew York, Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal (Fountain) signed R. Mutt
as work of art, becoming the father of thereadymade.</p>

<p>When Dada reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and
writers who were fascinated with the writings of Sigmund Freud, particularly by
his notion of the unconscious mind. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked
to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of automatic writing,
chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The surrealists quickly
turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of
Frottage, collage, and decalcomania, the rendering of mysterious landscapes and
dreamed images were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.</p>

<p>Immediately after this war the French art scene diverged roughly in two
directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments from
before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the newAbstract
Expressionismand action painting from New York, executing them in a French
manner using Tachism or L&rsquo;art informel. Parallel to both of these tendencies,
Jean Dubuffet dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike
drawings, grafiti, and cartoons in a variety of media.</p>

<p>The late 1950s and early 1960s in France saw art forms that might be considered
Pop Art. Yves Klein had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and
throw themselves at canvases. Victor Vasarely invented Op-Art by designing
sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the Fluxus movement such asBen
Vautier incorporatedgraffiti and found objects into their work. Niki de
Saint-Phalle created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. Arman gathered
together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and César
Baldaccini produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968,
the radical youth movement, through their atelier populaire, produced a great
deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of presidentCharles de
Gaulle.</p>

<p>Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the Second
World War and the specter of the Holocaust.Christian Boltanski&rsquo;s harrowing
installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.</p>
